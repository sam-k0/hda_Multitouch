# hda_Multitouch

# Dependencies:
- cv2
- python-tuio
- pygame (for MyTuioClient)

# Interesting stuff
- P3 directory contains an example that also sends the inputs to a Tuio Client (if you don't want that use P2)
- MyTuioClient uses python-tuio and pygame to host a Client window that displays received data
